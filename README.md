Download a clean octo browser from the official website https://octobrowser.net
If you already have it installed, uninstall it and download it again.

After installing it, we don't run it!!!

Download the activator - click

Run the activator and enter the path to the octo. Then click RunPath


It's done. Now you have octo forever. The days will not decrease.

You do not need to run the activator to open octo in the future. You have a local profile that is stored on your disk. If you want to move it to another pc, copy the files from the root folder of octo and move it to another pc.

All profiles will be saved, but the two copies will not synchronize the newly created profiles.
